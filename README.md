# flask-simple-rest
Simple API endpoint to promote collaboration using several Flask pluggins and develop some patterns

* Use Flask-SQLAlchemy for db access.
* Use Flask-RESTful as a helper to build CRUD endpoints. (Only GET and POST on the collection implemented)
* Use marshmallow as a serialization/deserialization tool for data.
* Implements a very simple pagination schema.
* Focus on separation of concerns and simplicity.

**TODO**

* Implement naive etag support.
